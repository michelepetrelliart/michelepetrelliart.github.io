With more than two decades of artistic exploration, Michele Petrelli masterfully combines in his works vibrant elements of nature and humanity with the fascination of darker themes. Preferring to depict the enigmatic shadows of life, Michele's artistic journey has evolved significantly, embracing different representational techniques.<!--
The subjects of his latest paintings are mysterious and disturbing characters, transfigurations of ordinary people, lovers, gods or monsters hovering in the void, at other times sinking into nocturnal abysses. Endless perspectives of mighty architecture or extremely fragile structures that can be moved by a gust of wind form the backdrop for an intense dreamlike pattern. Sometimes the subjects appear pure and free, other times ugly and gloomy. The dynamism of the poses highlights this unstoppable succession of changing states. --><br/>
  His artistic style is deeply evocative and immersive, characterized by a sense of unease and emotional intensity. The figures he portrays seem suspended between dream and nightmare, between the world of the living and a deeper, psychological dimension. His subjects often have lost or intense gazes, as if they are aware of a truth that the viewer can only intuit.<br/>
The compositions are charged with narrative tension, with bodies intertwining or distancing themselves, suggesting complex relationships of attraction and repulsion, suffering and connection. The use of color is equally significant: dark tones, deep greens, and murky yellows evoke a sense of decay and mystery, while bursts of red explode like signals of danger, passion, or wounds.

There is a constant search for humanity in a state of extreme vulnerability, with figures conveying a sense of loneliness even when in pairs. His works tell stories of fractured identities, tormented relationships, and bodies existing at the edge between presence and dissolution. It is an art that does not seek to reassure but rather to lay bare the fragility and intensity of the human experience.




<br/><br/>

  <i>When I was younger, after a carefree childhood and adolescence, I arrived without realizing it, on the threshold of an abyss. I felt that I could never go back but that the only way was through it. In doing so, however, I lacked the courage to keep my eyes open. Defeated then, I tried to turn back with a great dread inside me that I was running out of time. This terror became so great that I could no longer sleep and it amplified all my sensations. Everything brought me suffering. The beautiful things I saw and heard made me think of all that I had lost. While the bad ones described exactly where I ended up. I was trapped as some kind of ghost still wrapped in bone and flesh. Over the years, this fear of mine has grown weaker and weaker. However, the dark times still come back from time to time bringing me back to that otherworldly dimension. When they arrive, I can only wait for them to dissolve.</i><br /><br />

In recent years, I have formulated Radical Non-Dual Determinism (RNDD),
an inquiry into the illusion of the separate self. <br /><br />
</div>

<!--h1 style="text-align: left;">
<b>Michele Petrelli</b> contemporary italian artist,</h1>
was keening about painting from when he was very young and he graduated from the Art School in 1991. He says about himself:<br />
“I am an encephalon in a glass vial. I am a visual-auditory-tactile artist. I don't despise the thought that wanders into the spirit of things.”.
During the early part of his life he drew horrific figures that seemed to come from his emotional states. They were monochromatic drawings with a strong presence of black.<br /><br />


  This dark side of him is still present today and is collected in the gallery entitled "Shadowy".<br />
From 2008, Petrelli lives happily with his partner away from the city. He has painted a lot in these years.

  <h3>Petrelli's style</h3-->


<!--i>"First, I have to quote the words of the artist himself revealing what he is set on doing : " The message is to destroy the beauty of deceptive appearances. Penetrating the unfinished.  Getting to the origin of all things ".
  In so doing, his exacerbated sensitivity will dissect his subjects , and, although obviously in love with Beauty, he will try not to succumb to it but give his new version of it...In the mean time, and whether intentional or not Beauty has become an underlying , endemic characteristic in his work.<br />
   We can feel some kind of latent clash between his brain and his instinct (something he himself proclaims). Effectively, you can easily perceive , while  studying his work, that he just wished he could let himself go...Paint them just as they are. But then, his brain will not allow him this luxury. His private demon will make him dig up a new way to uncover,  to search , to judge and then reveal his discovery.
   He will always add a very soft quality to his touches , making us more susceptible and more responding to his message.<br />
   All of his portraits  bear a dreamlike aura, not forgetting though that nightmares are also dreams...The eyes being his main concern, he very successfully reaches, and depicts the innermost hidden, intricate meanders of the human mind."</i><br />

<!--With more than two decades of artistic exploration, Michele Petrelli masterfully combines vibrant elements of nature and humanity with the fascination of darker themes in his works. Preferring to represent the enigmatic shadows of life, Michele's artistic journey has evolved significantly, embracing both analog and digital techniques. His process often begins with an analog sketch in acrylic, later digitized and enhanced by custom-designed digital brushes that mimic realistic strokes. Michele prides himself on the continuous refinement of his tools, emphasizing that his creative process remains free of automated aids. His commitment to authenticity is further demonstrated by videos that capture his artistic journey.<br/>
In the "Shadowy" collection the subjects hover in the void, at other times they sink into marine abysses, or emerge from a web of shapes and lines that dissolve into the dark. Infinite perspectives of powerful architecture or very fragile structures, which can be moved by a gust of wind, are the background of an intense oneiric scheme. Petrelli depicts the infinite impotence of the human being in front of the occult, the "non-manifest".-->
